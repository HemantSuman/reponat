        <h1>Intellectual Property Policy</h1>

        <p><strong>LEGAL RESOLUTION CENTRE PRIVATE LIMITED (the 'Company')</strong> has an efficient Intellectual Property Policy and Intellectual Property Management guidelines (Collectively referred to as 'IP Policy', hereinafter) in place basically to maintain absolute clarity on IPR related issues such as ownership, rights and obligation of employees and Company, rights and obligation of customers and Company, disclosure of work/ invention, non-disclosure of confidential information, liabilities in case of misappropriation of IP or resolution of IP related disputes strategically.</p>
        <p>Intellectual property (IP) is one of our most valuable assets. We rely on several types of intellectual property (such as trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, domain names, design rights etc) for our success in the market. IP helps us stay competitive, allows us to fund future successes, and supports each of our jobs at the Company. The Company has a consistent policy of identification of Company's intangible assets, prioritizing them according to Company's business plans, registering, exploiting and safeguarding them in order to benefit fully from IP in terms of revenue, reputation and market share. The Company's IP Policy also envisages protection and management of its own IP well, internally and with its business partners. We also want to respect the IP of others as we develop our products and services, run our business, and work with business partners.</p>
        <p>For clarifications, the term Company wherever used under this IP policy, shall include its Subsidiaries and Affiliates.</p>
