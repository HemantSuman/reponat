              In arbitration, both parties could elect the rules governing the arbitral proceedings, the law applicable to the merits of the dispute, the place of arbitration, the language(s) of arbitration, the number and the qualifications of arbitrators. Arbitration is usually faster than litigation before courts. Arbitral awards are final and binding on the parties (i.e. could not be revised on the merits); Parties can be only challenged for very limited causes all related to the procedures. Furthermore, arbitration is confidential; the arbitral awards could not be published unless after obtaining the prior written approval of the parties.

              As a general rule, arbitral awards enjoy the authority of res judicata and could be forcibly executed against the losing party after obtaining an enforcement order (exequatur) from the competent court. The award made by the arbitrator under National Arbitral Tribunal (Procedural) Rules is enforceable under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in the same manner as if the decree of the court in view of Sec. 36 read with 2(i) (a) of the A&C act 2015.
